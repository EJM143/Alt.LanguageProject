#Alternative Programming Language Project 1

# C#

Please include a README.md file with your repo that will serve as a survey of your explored programming language. Within it discuss several things in a few paragraphs: 

**Which programming language and version did you pick?**
The programming language I chose is C#  
 
**Why did you pick this programming language?**
I chose this programming language because of previously Collaborative Wiki assignment we completed for C# and I've discovered that it shares similarities with Java, making it easier to transition to and work with. 

 
**How your programming language chosen handles: object-oriented programming, file ingestion, conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, subprograms (functions/methods), unit testing and exception handling. If one or more of these are not supported by your programming language, indicate it as so.**
 
C# stands as a versatile language extensively employed in the development of Windows applications, web platforms, and games, notably through platforms like the Unity game engine. It extensively incorporates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, offering support for classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Developers can define classes, create objects based on them, utilize inheritance through the `:` symbol, and employ access modifiers for encapsulation, ensuring the secure organization and manipulation of data. 
 
For file ingestion, C# relies on the .NET Framework's File and StreamReader classes. These classes provide methods for efficiently reading data from files, enabling developers to open, read, and close files as necessary. Conditional statements in C#, such as `if`, `else if`, and `else`, allow for decision-making based on specified conditions. These statements operate similarly to those in other C-based languages, facilitating logical branching within the code. 
 
Assignment statements in C# employ the = operator, aligning with standard practice across programming languages, empowering developers to assign values to variables, manipulate data, and execute various operations. C# offers a variety of loop constructs, including `for`, `foreach`, `while`, and `do-while`, further enhance code readability and efficiency, enabling iterative execution of code blocks predicated on specified conditions or data iteration. 

Subprograms, known as methods in C#, play a crucial role in code organization and reusability. Developers can define methods within classes to perform specific tasks, with parameters, return values, and access modifiers controlling their behavior and visibility. Unit testing is well-supported in C# through frameworks like NUnit, MSTest, and xUnit.net. These frameworks facilitate the creation and execution of tests, ensuring the integrity of individual units or components within the codebase.  
  
Exception handling in C# is facilitated through `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw` blocks. Developers can employ these constructs to handle runtime errors gracefully, ensuring proper management of exceptions and allowing for the continuation of program execution under unexpected conditions. Overall, C# provides comprehensive support for a wide range of programming concepts, making it a versatile and popular choice for software development across various domains. 
 
**List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.**
 
Answer the following questions (and provide a corresponding screen showing output answering them): 
 
What company (oem) has the highest average weight of the phone body? 
Was there any phones that were announced in one year and released in another? What are they? Give me the oem and models. 
How many phones have only one feature sensor? 
What year had the most phones launched in any year later than 1999?
